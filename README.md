# Formant Analysis Game

## Overview

This project is a web-based game centered around analyzing speech formants (F1 and F2). Players adjust their voices to make the formants (F1 and F2) as close as possible to the coordinates of a target sound. Real-time formant analysis is implemented using WebAudio, with interactive graphics to visualize the results.

## Features
1. Audio Processing:

    - Real-time speech recording analysis to extract F1 and F2.

    - Updates every 100 milliseconds.

2. Coordinate Mapping:

    - F1 and F2 values are mapped to 2D coordinates to create visualizations.

3. Game Mechanics:
    -  Players adjust their voices to make F1 and F2 match the target coordinates.

## Usage

1. Open the web page (...).

2. Allow microphone access.

3. Adjust your voice according to the target point.
